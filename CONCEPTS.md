# Concepts

Shared domain vocabulary for this project — entities, named processes, and status concepts with project-specific meaning. Seeded with core domain vocabulary, then accretes as ce-compound and ce-compound-refresh process learnings; direct edits are fine. Glossary only, not a spec or catch-all.

## Video & media

### Video

A piece of watchable content — a feature film, a segment of one, or a container node (series, collection) in a parent/child tree. A Video is not directly playable on its own: its watchable audio comes from its Dubs and its subtitles from a Video Edition. Videos relate to each other as parents and children, which is how series and their episodes — and "Up Next" siblings — are formed.

### Dub

One audio-language variant of a Video — the unit the watch screen's language picker selects (a popular title can have thousands of Dubs). A Dub carries its own playable stream and its own set of downloadable renditions, and points at the Video Edition whose subtitle tracks apply to it.
_Avoid:_ variant (the mobile client aliases Dubs as "variants").

### Video Edition

A cut/edition of a Video that owns the subtitle tracks. Subtitles hang off the Edition, not off individual Dubs — a Dub references the Edition whose subtitles apply, so many Dubs sharing an edition share one set of subtitle tracks.
