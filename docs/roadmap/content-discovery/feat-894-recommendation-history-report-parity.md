## Scope and acceptance

Own CTR/engagement/history adapters, visit admission/archive integration and operator trace/exposure readers. Preserve the active experiment, sticky assignment, operational qualification/attribution, late cutoff, immutable revisions and archived counter fences. Fixed-as-of parity applies to successfully delivered/backfilled evidence, including duplicates/corrections; accepted live export loss must remain explicit coverage loss. Keep necessary compact A/B accounting and never label a partial analytical sample as complete. Preserve 14-day anonymous coverage disclosure, authorization/auditing and error visibility. Distinguish serving authority from ClickHouse history in storage inventories; there is no forwarding store.

## Context

- Parent: [feat-888](feat-888-recommendation-event-storage-migration.md).
- Specification: [event storage migration](../../plans/2026-10-28-recommendation-event-storage-spec.md).
- Read `AGENTS.md`, `apps/admin/AGENTS.md`, relevant `apps/admin/CLAUDE.md` guidance and `docs/analytics-and-recommendation-policy.md`.
- Duration is a planning placeholder. Completion requires integrated tests and receipts for this scope; production claims belong to feat-896.

## Evidence

Implementation pending.
