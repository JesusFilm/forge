# Plan Artifact: #76

## Objective

Doppler project `web` with environment configs is integrated into CI/deploy, with clear mapping to web env contract and no sensitive values hardcoded in repository.

## Planned approach

1. Use environment-scoped Doppler service tokens for CI.
2. Add validation step to fail fast if required env keys are missing.
3. Keep `.env.example` non-secret contract in sync.

## Validation

- [ ] Doppler project `web` has configs: `preview`, `stage`, `prod`.
- [ ] Required keys are mapped to `apps/web/src/env.ts` expectations.
- [ ] GitHub Actions obtains and injects correct env values per branch/environment.
- [ ] Secrets ownership and rotation cadence are documented.
- [ ] No drift between declared env contract and runtime-provided variables.
