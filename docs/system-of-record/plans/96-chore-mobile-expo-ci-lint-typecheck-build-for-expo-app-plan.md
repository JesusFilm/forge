# Plan Artifact: #96

## Objective

- CI job(s) that run for the Expo app: lint, typecheck, and build (e.g. `expo export` or EAS build validation).
- Runs on PR/push when Expo app or its config is affected (or always for simplicity).
- Aligns with repo workflow (no merge with failing CI).

## Planned approach

1. Add `mobile/expo` to Turbo pipeline with lint and build tasks; wire in existing `.github/workflows/ci.yml` if monorepo uses Turbo.
2. Or: dedicated job in ci.yml that cd's to `mobile/expo` and runs lint, typecheck, build.

## Validation

- [ ] Lint runs for `mobile/expo` (e.g. ESLint) and passes on main.
- [ ] Typecheck (e.g. tsc or Expo typecheck) runs and passes.
- [ ] Build step runs (e.g. `expo export` or equivalent) and succeeds.
- [ ] Documented in README or CONTRIBUTING if needed.
