# Plan Artifact: #80

## Objective

Both native apps have compile-ready shells with clear local build commands and minimal startup screens, establishing a reliable baseline for follow-on GraphQL and CI work.

## Planned approach

1. iOS: create app target/workspace and wire a minimal SwiftUI app entrypoint.
2. Android: complete app module runtime wiring and verify `assembleDebug`.

## Validation

- [ ] iOS has a buildable app target/scheme (not package-only) with a minimal startup screen.
- [ ] Android has complete app entry wiring (manifest/activity/resources) and a minimal startup screen.
- [ ] Local debug build commands are documented and verified for both platforms.
- [ ] Scope stays platform-native (SwiftUI + Kotlin/Compose) with no shared business logic.
