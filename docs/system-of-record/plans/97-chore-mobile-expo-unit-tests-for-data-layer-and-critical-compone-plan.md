# Plan Artifact: #97

## Objective

- Unit tests for the Experience fetch and section data layer, covering mapping logic for all 10 section types.
- Unit tests for critical UI or hooks (e.g. section renderer dispatch, nested content resolution).
- Tests run in CI (see chore for CI); no flaky or environment-dependent tests in core paths.
- E2E strategy can be documented as deferred if out of scope.

## Planned approach

1. Jest or Expo's test runner; mock GraphQL client in data layer tests.
2. Keep tests colocated or in `__tests__` under `mobile/expo`.
3. Use the sample Experience (slug: `easter`, documentId: `lr6luew6oh4hurag4n8s0ddz`) as a fixture for integration-style mapping tests.

## Validation

- [ ] Data layer tests: at least one test per fetch path (watch home, experience-by-slug) or mapping logic.
- [ ] Mapping tests for each of the 10 section types: VideoHero, MediaCollection, CTA, Text, Video, BibleQuotesCarousel, RelatedQuestions, Card, Section, Container.
- [ ] Nested content tests: Section → recursive content, Container → slots → recursive content.
- [ ] MediaCollection variant tests (carousel, collection, grid, hero, player).
- [ ] SectionDispatcher tests: correct component resolved for each `__typename`.
- [ ] Tests run in CI (via Expo or Jest).
- [ ] README or CONTRIBUTING updated with how to run tests.
