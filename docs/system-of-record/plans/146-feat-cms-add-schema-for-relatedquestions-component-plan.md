# Plan Artifact: #146

## Objective

- A RelatedQuestions component exists with repeatable question/answer pairs (or relation to existing Q&A content) and optional heading.

## Planned approach

1. Add `components/sections/related-questions.json` with `heading` and `questions` (repeatable component with `question`, `answer` text fields).
2. Alternatively relation to a Questions collection if Q&As are reused across pages.

## Validation

- [ ] RelatedQuestions component JSON schema added in CMS.
- [ ] Supports at least heading + repeatable items (question, answer).
- [ ] Component registered and available; GraphQL regenerated if contracts change.
