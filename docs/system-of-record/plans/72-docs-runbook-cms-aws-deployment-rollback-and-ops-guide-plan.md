# Plan Artifact: #72

## Objective

A practical runbook for operators/agents with step-by-step procedures, guardrails, and checklists for normal deploys and failures.

## Planned approach

1. Single markdown runbook under docs with quickstart + deep sections.
2. Include copy-paste command snippets for non-destructive diagnostics.
3. Add change management checklist to PR template/reference if needed.

## Validation

- [ ] Runbook includes bootstrap prerequisites and required permissions.
- [ ] Deploy path documented for stage and prod (normal flow).
- [ ] Verification checklist includes health, DB, asset upload/read, auth-critical path.
- [ ] Rollback path documented for ECS task definition and infra rollback boundaries.
- [ ] Secret rotation checklist references AWS SSM Parameter Store process.
- [ ] Links to dashboards/log locations and common failure triage.
