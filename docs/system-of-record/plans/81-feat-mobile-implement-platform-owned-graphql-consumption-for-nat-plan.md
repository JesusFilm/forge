# Plan Artifact: #81

## Objective

iOS and Android each consume the GraphQL API via typed, generated native clients and platform-owned operations, with parity guardrails for core content behavior.

## Planned approach

1. Use `apps/cms/schema.graphql` as source for Apollo iOS and Apollo Kotlin codegen in platform folders.
2. Mirror web query intent (not shared files) to keep behavior aligned while preserving platform ownership.

## Validation

- [ ] iOS defines its own operations and generated client artifacts for the required read path.
- [ ] Android defines its own operations and generated client artifacts for the required read path.
- [ ] Each platform implements its `ContentClient` adapter with endpoint + bearer-token auth.
- [ ] A parity checklist exists for locale/error/required field handling across platforms.
- [ ] No shared operation files are introduced between iOS and Android.
