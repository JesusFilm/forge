# Plan Artifact: #78

## Objective

- Script that outputs STRAPI_API_TOKEN from env or .env (or `.` if unset) so agents can use it safely.
- Script that upserts an Experience by slug (POST if missing, PUT if exists) with optional payload (sections, isHomepage).
- Agent skill so the agent knows when and how to run these scripts.

## Planned approach

1. Node scripts (no extra deps) that load .env with a simple line parse, call fetch() for REST.
2. Skill follows create-skill guidance: concise, third-person description, clear when to use.

## Validation

- [ ] `scripts/get-strapi-token.js` prints token or `.`; loads from .env / apps/cms/.env.
- [ ] `scripts/upsert-experience.js` accepts slug, optional locale, optional payload.json; uses Strapi REST to find by slug+locale and create or update.
- [ ] `.cursor/skills/strapi-experience-scripts/SKILL.md` documents prerequisites, usage, and payload shape for sections.
- [ ] `apps/cms/.env.example` documents STRAPI_API_TOKEN and STRAPI_URL for scripts.
