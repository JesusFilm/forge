# apps/admin — Forge Admin

## What this app does

Custom management platform — the strategic replacement for Strapi and
eventual home for the manager app. V1 ships the architecture (Next.js +
GraphQL Yoga + Pothos + Prisma + pgvector + useworkflow + Better Auth)
and proves it with real content types (Experiences, Videos) while Strapi
continues to serve existing consumers.

See the origin docs for full context:

- Requirements: `docs/brainstorms/2026-04-13-admin-app-graphql-postgres-requirements.md`
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-04-13-002-feat-admin-app-graphql-postgres-plan.md`

## Stack

- Next.js 16+ App Router with TypeScript strict mode
- GraphQL Yoga + Pothos (with Prisma + scope-auth plugins) — single API at `/api/graphql`
- Prisma 6.x + PostgreSQL + pgvector (HNSW index) — sole data access layer
- Better Auth (DB-backed sessions) + server-side Firebase email/password fallback for transparent migration
- SSO via Better Auth native adapters: Google, Apple, Okta
- useworkflow (`workflow` npm package) for durable background jobs
- Upstash Redis (TCP / `ioredis`) for rate limiting
- Railway deployment (NIXPACKS, standalone output)
- Doppler for env var management (project: `forge-admin`)

## Conventions (Unit 1 baseline — expands with each unit)

- Env vars validated at startup via `src/config/env.ts`. Never read `process.env` directly.
- Env vars managed by Doppler (project: `forge-admin`). Use `pnpm fetch-secrets` for local dev.
- Tests colocated as `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` beside source files.

## Development

```bash
pnpm fetch-secrets    # Pull .env from Doppler (forge-admin)
pnpm --filter @forge/admin dev           # http://localhost:3003
pnpm --filter @forge/admin build
pnpm --filter @forge/admin test
pnpm --filter @forge/admin lint
pnpm --filter @forge/admin typecheck
```

## Deployment

Railway service `forge-admin` (Doppler project of the same name).
Deployment caveats in `docs/solutions/deployment/nextjs-pnpm-monorepo-railway-standalone.md`
apply: set `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` in Railway dashboard (not `[deploy.env]`).

## Unit 4 — data model highlights

- **Experience + ExperienceLocale** with per-locale rows (independent
  publish state, unique `(locale, slug)` where `status = 'published'`).
  `embedding` column is NULL until the embedding workflow runs; HNSW
  partial index excludes NULLs; `embedding` is NEVER exposed via GraphQL
  (technical control in `src/graphql/types/experience.ts` — field list
  omits it; `src/graphql/schema.test.ts` asserts no `embed|vector|similarit`
  field leaks).
- **Video + VideoLocale + VideoDub + VideoDubDownload** with Core
  provenance (`coreId`, `source` enum, `coreUpdatedAt`, `syncedAt`).
  Source-authoritative contract: `source='manager'` rows are never
  overwritten by Core sync. `lengthInMilliseconds` is `BigInt` (int4
  truncates at 596 hours) and exposed as a string in GraphQL to preserve
  precision.
- **`VideoDub` is the rename of Core's `video-variant`.** The varying
  axis is the audio language (a dub of the parent Edition's frames),
  not the frames themselves. Boundary translation (`coreVariant → dub`)
  lives in the Core-sync transform layer (Unit 10), not at the DB. See
  migration `0006_rename_variant_to_dub`. Quality tiers (mp4 480p,
  720p, …) live in `VideoDubDownload`.
- **Reference data** (Language, Country, Keyword, Continent,
  CountryLanguage, VideoOrigin, VideoEdition, MuxVideo, BibleBook) uses a
  single row with a `name` JSONB column keyed by locale — pragmatic for
  low-cardinality display-only localization.
- **Block schema** — Zod discriminated union in `src/domain/blocks.ts`
  with three scopes (top-level, section content, container-slot content)
  matching the 16 legacy CMS section components. `.strict()` rejects
  unknown keys; `quizButton` is scoped to `section.content`; section
  cannot contain another section. Adding a new block type is a single
  Zod schema + `t` literal + union entry — no Prisma migration required.
- **Pothos type classification** — every type carries
  `@classification abac-gated` or `@classification public-shape` JSDoc
  so Unit 6 can enforce the split-by-classification rule (abac-gated
  relations must route through a service resolver, not `t.relation`).

### Unit 3 spike — sign-off record (2026-04-13)

The architecture spike (Yoga + Pothos + Prisma plugin + scope-auth) was
verified against a live Postgres on 2026-04-13 and the go/no-go gate passed.

**Observed results against a seeded DB (2 Ping rows, 3 PingChild rows):**

- `{ pingAll { id message children { label } } }` with `x-spike-role: EDITOR`
  issued exactly two Prisma queries:
  1. `SELECT … FROM "public"."ping" ORDER BY "created_at" DESC`
  2. `SELECT … FROM "public"."ping_child" WHERE "ping_id" IN ($1,$2)`
     This is the batched IN-clause pattern the Pothos Prisma plugin uses for
     nested relations — no N+1.
- Unauthenticated `{ pingAll { id } }` rejected at the scope-auth layer
  before Prisma was invoked: `"Not authorized to resolve Query.pingAll"`.
- Unauthenticated `{ pingPublic(id: "p1") { ... } }` resolved to data for a
  Ping with `isPublic: true` (the `public: true` scope opts into anonymous
  access); the same query for `isPublic: false` returned `null` because the
  service's WHERE clause filtered it out.
- `fetchAPI: { Response }` streams correctly through Next App Router.

**Rerun the runbook (DB-dependent sign-off) any time the stack versions change:**

1. Start Postgres with pgvector extension available.
2. `pnpm --filter @forge/admin db:migrate:dev` — applies 0001_init + 0002_spike_ping.
3. Seed a Ping with ≥2 PingChild rows (Prisma Studio or psql).
4. Enable Prisma query logging (`NODE_ENV=development` already does this).
5. `pnpm --filter @forge/admin dev` and open `/api/graphql` in a browser.
6. Run this query with header `x-spike-role: EDITOR`:
   ```graphql
   query {
     pingAll {
       id
       message
       children {
         id
         label
       }
     }
   }
   ```
7. In server logs, count SQL statements: there should be at most TWO for
   the nested `children` resolution (one for the parent Ping, one JOINed
   or batched child lookup). Any higher count = Pothos `...query` is not
   being honored — STOP and re-evaluate before Unit 4.
8. Run the query WITHOUT the `x-spike-role` header: scope-auth must reject
   `pingAll` with an UNAUTHENTICATED-style error while `pingPublic(id)`
   still resolves for a Ping with `isPublic: true`.

Remove `Ping`/`PingChild` (schema + migration + graphql types + tests) in
the first Unit 4 commit after sign-off.

## Common pitfalls (grows with each unit)

- `[deploy.env]` in `railway.toml` is unreliable — put env vars in Railway dashboard.
- PostgreSQL 18 on Railway: `?::jsonb::text[]` cast unsupported. Use PG array
  literal `{val1,val2}` with `?::text[]` — see `src/db/pgvector.ts::toPgArray()`.
- Prisma 7.1.0 has pgvector migration regressions (Prisma issue #28867). Pin
  to Prisma 6.x until resolved.
- Pothos Prisma plugin requires `dmmf: Prisma.dmmf` in the builder config
  when `client` is a function (not a direct instance).
- Next.js App Router route handlers cannot directly export the Yoga instance:
  type signatures mismatch. Wrap in a `(request, context) => yoga.handle(...)`
  function and export that as `GET`/`POST`/`OPTIONS`.
