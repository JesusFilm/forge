# apps/admin — Forge Admin

## What this app does

Custom management platform — the strategic replacement for Strapi and
eventual home for the manager app. V1 ships the architecture (Next.js +
GraphQL Yoga + Pothos + Prisma + pgvector + useworkflow + Better Auth)
and proves it with real content types (Experiences, Videos) while Strapi
continues to serve existing consumers.

See the origin docs for full context:

- Requirements: `docs/brainstorms/2026-04-13-admin-app-graphql-postgres-requirements.md`
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-04-13-002-feat-admin-app-graphql-postgres-plan.md`

## Stack

- Next.js 16+ App Router with TypeScript strict mode
- GraphQL Yoga + Pothos (with Prisma + scope-auth plugins) — single API at `/api/graphql`
- Prisma 6.x + PostgreSQL + pgvector (HNSW index) — sole data access layer
- Better Auth (DB-backed sessions) + server-side Firebase email/password fallback for transparent migration
- SSO via Better Auth native adapters: Google, Apple, Okta
- useworkflow (`workflow` npm package) for durable background jobs
- Upstash Redis (TCP / `ioredis`) for rate limiting
- Railway deployment (NIXPACKS, standalone output)
- Doppler for env var management (project: `forge-admin`)

- [ ] Unit 13: CLAUDE.md playbook + reference-entity docs

## Conventions (Unit 1 baseline — expands with each unit)

- Env vars validated at startup via `src/config/env.ts`. Never read `process.env` directly.
- Env vars managed by Doppler (project: `forge-admin`). Use `pnpm fetch-secrets` for local dev.
- Tests colocated as `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` beside source files.

## Development

```bash
pnpm fetch-secrets    # Pull .env from Doppler (forge-admin)
pnpm --filter @forge/admin dev           # http://localhost:3003
pnpm --filter @forge/admin build
pnpm --filter @forge/admin test
pnpm --filter @forge/admin lint
pnpm --filter @forge/admin typecheck
```

## Deployment

Railway service `forge-admin` (Doppler project of the same name).
Deployment caveats in `docs/solutions/deployment/nextjs-pnpm-monorepo-railway-standalone.md`
apply: set `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` in Railway dashboard (not `[deploy.env]`).

## Unit 3 spike — DB-dependent sign-off (runbook)

The architecture spike (Yoga + Pothos + Prisma plugin + scope-auth) passes
its static verification: the stack builds, types check, and schema tests
run without a database. Before relying on this architecture for Unit 4,
execute these manual steps against a live Postgres:

1. Start Postgres with pgvector extension available.
2. `pnpm --filter @forge/admin db:migrate:dev` — applies 0001_init + 0002_spike_ping.
3. Seed a Ping with ≥2 PingChild rows (Prisma Studio or psql).
4. Enable Prisma query logging (`NODE_ENV=development` already does this).
5. `pnpm --filter @forge/admin dev` and open `/api/graphql` in a browser.
6. Run this query with header `x-spike-role: EDITOR`:
   ```graphql
   query {
     pingAll {
       id
       message
       children {
         id
         label
       }
     }
   }
   ```
7. In server logs, count SQL statements: there should be at most TWO for
   the nested `children` resolution (one for the parent Ping, one JOINed
   or batched child lookup). Any higher count = Pothos `...query` is not
   being honored — STOP and re-evaluate before Unit 4.
8. Run the query WITHOUT the `x-spike-role` header: scope-auth must reject
   `pingAll` with an UNAUTHENTICATED-style error while `pingPublic(id)`
   still resolves for a Ping with `isPublic: true`.

Remove `Ping`/`PingChild` (schema + migration + graphql types + tests) in
the first Unit 4 commit after sign-off.

## Common pitfalls (grows with each unit)

- `[deploy.env]` in `railway.toml` is unreliable — put env vars in Railway dashboard.
- PostgreSQL 18 on Railway: `?::jsonb::text[]` cast unsupported. Use PG array
  literal `{val1,val2}` with `?::text[]` — see `src/db/pgvector.ts::toPgArray()`.
- Prisma 7.1.0 has pgvector migration regressions (Prisma issue #28867). Pin
  to Prisma 6.x until resolved.
- Pothos Prisma plugin requires `dmmf: Prisma.dmmf` in the builder config
  when `client` is a function (not a direct instance).
- Next.js App Router route handlers cannot directly export the Yoga instance:
  type signatures mismatch. Wrap in a `(request, context) => yoga.handle(...)`
  function and export that as `GET`/`POST`/`OPTIONS`.
